## Temple-Flashcards

This app acts as a matching game using temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
On initial launch a collection view and table view shows pictures of the temples and a list of the temple names. 
When a correct match is clicked a message is displayed indicating the guess was correct and they are removed from the 
collection views. A reset button is provided to return to the initial app state.
Clicking the Study button will leave game mode where the temple name is displayed over the temple picture for study.

# Done Well
Overall the app looks really well and it functions as it is supposed to. The code is organized for easy management and understanding.
This project was super helpful for me to understand iOS development better. Things I particularly learned more about were drawing,
collection/table delegates and data sources, animations, and auto-layout.

# Not Done So Well
It would be better if the temple image and name are not removed from their respective views until the OK button is clicked on the alert message.
It would also be better if the collection view and table view were shuffled in different orders of each other. 


Showing the app to some of my friends the agreed that implementing the things I mentioned in the not so well section would make
the user experience much better. They were impressed by the app and thought it was pretty cool!
